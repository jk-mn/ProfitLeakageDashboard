Profit Leakage Detection & Revenue Optimization 🧠💸

Welcome to the Profit Leakage Detection & Revenue Optimization project — a data-driven powerhouse designed to uncover hidden profit leaks and supercharge revenue using advanced analytics, machine learning, and interactive dashboards. Built with real-world business acumen, this project transforms raw online sales data into actionable insights that drive smarter decision-making. 🚀
🎯 Project Objective
Detect and eliminate profit leaks caused by discounts, returns, and pricing inefficiencies in online retail. Leverage financial modeling, predictive analytics, and interactive visualizations to optimize revenue and boost profitability.
📊 Dataset Snapshot

Source: Kaggle – Online Retail Customer Clustering Dataset
Scope: ~500,000 B2B transactions from a UK-based retailer
Timeframe: 1-year period
File: OnlineRetail.csv

🛠️ What’s Inside?
This project is a full-stack analytics solution, combining SQL, Python, Power BI, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights and a polished, client-ready experience.
🧱 Data Architecture

Relational Schema: Transformed the flat OnlineRetail.csv into a PostgreSQL database for scalability and real-world simulation.
Tables:
Sales: Transaction details (InvoiceNo, Date, Quantity, etc.)
Products: SKU master (Product ID, Description, Unit Price, Category)
Returns: Derived from negative quantities
Customers: Customer ID, Country, Segment
Discounts: Simulated discount percentages per SKU/Invoice


SQL Usage:
Table creation and population
Complex joins and aggregations
Feature engineering (e.g., Total Price, Profit, Net Profit)



🛠️ Feature Engineering
Engineered features to uncover profit leaks and optimize revenue:

TotalPrice: Quantity * UnitPrice
Discount%: Simulated 0%–20% discounts
CostPrice: UnitPrice * 0.7 (assumed 30% margin)
Profit: (UnitPrice - CostPrice) * Quantity
NetProfit: Profit - (Discount% * TotalPrice)
ReturnRate: Percentage of returns per SKU/Customer

📈 Analytical Highlights

🔥 Profit Leaks: Identified SKUs bleeding profit due to high returns or aggressive discounts.
💸 Discount Trends: Pinpointed countries with excessive discounting (e.g., Germany’s 12% margin loss).
📉 Revenue Loss: Quantified losses from over-discounting low-margin SKUs.
🔁 Returns Analysis: Highlighted high-return SKUs and Q4 return spikes.
🌍 Geographic Profitability: Mapped profit by region for targeted strategies.
⏳ Trends: Tracked monthly revenue and profit seasonality.
🧪 What-If Analysis: Modeled margin changes to simulate profit impact.

📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboard
A client-ready dashboard with 4 dynamic pages:

Executive Summary:
KPIs: Revenue, Net Profit, Return %, Avg. Discount


Profit Leakage:
Breakdown by product, region, segment
Slicer for discount simulation (0%–20%)


Returns Analysis:
SKU-level return rates
Quarterly spike tracking


Trend Analysis:
Monthly profit trends
Seasonal discount patterns


Interactive Features: Slicers for regions, categories, and discounts; tooltips for business impact.

⚙️ ML-Lite Predictive Layer

Objective: Predict high-return-risk SKUs.
Approach:
Model: Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn) for binary classification, chosen for interpretability and performance on imbalanced data.
Features:
Discount%: Discount rate applied to SKU.
ReturnRate: Historical return rate per SKU.
Quantity: Transaction volume.
Margin: (UnitPrice - CostPrice) / UnitPrice.
Month: Extracted from InvoiceDate for seasonality.
Category: Product category (e.g., fragile, non-fragile).


Preprocessing: Dropped nulls, one-hot encoded Category, scaled numerical features with StandardScaler.
Training: 80/20 train-test split, with grid search for hyperparameters (e.g., C=1.0).
Output: sku_return_risk.csv with SKUs and predicted return probabilities (>50% flagged as high-risk).


Impact: Proactive SKU tagging for quality checks and discount optimization.

Profit Leakage by SKU: Bar chart showing top 20% of SKUs causing 70% of profit loss, with slicers for discount rate (0–20%) and category.
Q4 Return Trends: Line graph highlighting 3× return spikes in Q4, with annotations for fragile item categories.
Discount Impact Analysis: Scatter plot of discounts vs. profit margins, revealing >15% discounts erode low-margin SKUs.
Geographic Profit Map: Heatmap of profit by country, highlighting Germany’s 12% margin loss from aggressive discounting.

🧑‍💻 Code Snippets
Data Cleaning (ml_prediction.py)
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('OnlineRetail.csv')

# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['CustomerID', 'InvoiceNo'])

# Feature engineering
df['TotalPrice'] = df['Quantity'] * df['UnitPrice']
df['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate']).dt.month
df['Margin'] = (df['UnitPrice'] - (df['UnitPrice'] * 0.7)) / df['UnitPrice']

# Scale numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['TotalPrice', 'Quantity']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['TotalPrice', 'Quantity']])

ML Prediction (ml_prediction.py)
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Prepare features and target
features = ['TotalPrice', 'Quantity', 'Month', 'Margin', 'Discount%']
X = df[features]
y = df['IsReturn']  # Binary: 1 for return, 0 for no return

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Logistic Regression
model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and save high-risk SKUs
df['ReturnRisk'] = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
df[df['ReturnRisk'] > 0.5][['StockCode', 'ReturnRisk']].to_csv('sku_return_risk.csv', index=False)

SQL Query (analysis.sql)
SELECT 
    p.StockCode,
    p.Description,
    SUM(s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.ReturnID IS NOT NULL THEN s.Quantity * s.UnitPrice ELSE 0 END) AS ReturnLoss,
    AVG(d.DiscountPercent) AS AvgDiscount
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.StockCode = p.StockCode
LEFT JOIN Returns r ON s.InvoiceNo = r.InvoiceNo
LEFT JOIN Discounts d ON s.InvoiceNo = d.InvoiceNo
GROUP BY p.StockCode, p.Description
ORDER BY ReturnLoss DESC
LIMIT 100;

💡 Key Business Insights

“20% of SKUs account for 70% of net profit loss.” Target these for immediate action.
“Germany’s aggressive discounts reduce margins by 12%.” Reassess regional pricing strategies.
“Q4 returns spike 3×, likely due to fragile items.” Improve packaging or quality control.
“Discounts >15% on low-margin SKUs hurt overall profit.” Set discount caps for better margins.
