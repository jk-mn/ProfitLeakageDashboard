Profit Leakage Detection & Revenue Optimization üß†üí∏
Welcome to the Profit Leakage Detection & Revenue Optimization project ‚Äî a data-driven powerhouse designed to uncover hidden profit leaks and supercharge revenue using advanced analytics, machine learning, and interactive dashboards. Built with real-world business acumen, this project transforms raw online sales data into actionable insights that drive smarter decision-making. üöÄ
üéØ Project Objective
Detect and eliminate profit leaks caused by discounts, returns, and pricing inefficiencies in online retail. Leverage financial modeling, predictive analytics, and interactive visualizations to optimize revenue and boost profitability.

üìä Dataset Snapshot

Source: Kaggle ‚Äì Online Retail Customer Clustering Dataset
Scope: ~500,000 B2B transactions from a UK-based retailer
Timeframe: 1-year period
File: OnlineRetail.csv


üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Inside?
This project is a full-stack analytics solution, combining SQL, Python, Power BI, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights and a polished, client-ready experience.
üß± Data Architecture

Relational Schema: Transformed the flat OnlineRetail.csv into a PostgreSQL database for scalability and real-world simulation.
Tables:
Sales: Transaction details (InvoiceNo, Date, Quantity, etc.)
Products: SKU master (Product ID, Description, Unit Price, Category)
Returns: Derived from negative quantities
Customers: Customer ID, Country, Segment
Discounts: Simulated discount percentages per SKU/Invoice


SQL Usage:
Table creation and population
Complex joins and aggregations
Feature engineering (e.g., Total Price, Profit, Net Profit)



üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering
Engineered features to uncover profit leaks and optimize revenue:

TotalPrice: Quantity * UnitPrice
Discount%: Simulated 0%‚Äì20% discounts
CostPrice: UnitPrice * 0.7 (assumed 30% margin)
Profit: (UnitPrice - CostPrice) * Quantity
NetProfit: Profit - (Discount% * TotalPrice)
ReturnRate: Percentage of returns per SKU/Customer

üìà Analytical Highlights

üî• Profit Leaks: Identified SKUs bleeding profit due to high returns or aggressive discounts.
üí∏ Discount Trends: Pinpointed countries with excessive discounting (e.g., Germany‚Äôs 12% margin loss).
üìâ Revenue Loss: Quantified losses from over-discounting low-margin SKUs.
üîÅ Returns Analysis: Highlighted high-return SKUs and Q4 return spikes.
üåç Geographic Profitability: Mapped profit by region for targeted strategies.
‚è≥ Trends: Tracked monthly revenue and profit seasonality.
üß™ What-If Analysis: Modeled margin changes to simulate profit impact.

üìä Interactive Power BI Dashboard
A client-ready dashboard with 4 dynamic pages:

Executive Summary:
KPIs: Revenue, Net Profit, Return %, Avg. Discount


Profit Leakage:
Breakdown by product, region, segment
Slicer for discount simulation (0%‚Äì20%)


Returns Analysis:
SKU-level return rates
Quarterly spike tracking


Trend Analysis:
Monthly profit trends
Seasonal discount patterns




Interactive Features: Slicers for regions, categories, and discounts; tooltips for business impact.

‚öôÔ∏è ML-Lite Predictive Layer

Objective: Predict high-return-risk SKUs.
Approach:
Aggregated SKU-level features: Discount %, ReturnRate, Quantity, Margin
Model: Logistic Regression/Decision Tree (scikit-learn)
Output: Flags SKUs with >50% return probability


Impact: Proactive SKU tagging for quality checks and discount optimization.


üí° Key Business Insights

‚Äú20% of SKUs account for 70% of net profit loss.‚Äù Target these for immediate action.
‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs aggressive discounts reduce margins by 12%.‚Äù Reassess regional pricing strategies.
‚ÄúQ4 returns spike 3√ó, likely due to fragile items.‚Äù Improve packaging or quality control.
‚ÄúDiscounts >15% on low-margin SKUs hurt overall profit.‚Äù Set discount caps for better margins.


üß† Skills Showcased

SQL (PostgreSQL): Complex queries, joins, aggregations, and subqueries
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn): Data prep, ML predictions, and Power BI integration
Power BI: Interactive dashboards, what-if scenarios, and storytelling
Excel: Scenario modeling and cross-checks
Financial Modeling: Cost-to-profit calculations with discount impacts

Power BI Dashboard: Client-facing, interactive, and exportable
One-Pager Business Summary: Concise PDF deck for stakeholders
ML Prediction File: sku_return_risk.csv for proactive SKU management


üöÄ Why This Project Stands Out

Real-World Impact: Directly addresses profit leaks and revenue optimization with actionable insights.
End-to-End Solution: From raw data to client-ready dashboards and ML predictions.
Scalable & Modular: Built with enterprise-grade SQL architecture and flexible Python pipelines.
Visual Storytelling: Power BI dashboards make insights accessible and engaging.
Business-First: Recommendations grounded in financial modeling and market realities.
