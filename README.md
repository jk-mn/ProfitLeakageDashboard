📊 Profit Leakage Detection & Revenue Optimization
🔍 Overview

Businesses often lose revenue due to discount misuse, product returns, or customer churn.
This project demonstrates how to detect hidden profit leaks and optimize revenue streams using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

The workflow mimics a real-world analytics pipeline:

Data modeling in SQL (PostgreSQL)

Exploratory & predictive analysis in Python

Interactive dashboards in Power BI for stakeholders

🚀 Project Highlights

✅ Built a 5-table relational schema (Sales, Products, Returns, Customers, Discounts)
✅ Applied feature engineering for customer segmentation and profitability metrics
✅ Designed Power BI dashboards for:

Profit leakage hotspots

Customer retention insights

Discount vs. revenue impact
✅ Developed a predictive ML layer (basic classification/regression) to forecast risks
✅ Implemented SQL queries for ETL & KPIs (gross margin, discount abuse, return rates)

🛠️ Tech Stack

SQL (PostgreSQL) → data cleaning, joins, feature creation

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) → analysis & machine learning

Power BI → dashboards & interactive reporting

Revenue Leakage by Product Category

Customer Profitability Segmentation

Discount Sensitivity Analysis

🧠 Key Insights

15% of customers contribute to 70% of profit → focus retention strategies here.

Deep discounts often correlated with high return rates, leading to hidden losses.

Predictive model flags customers likely to churn, enabling proactive intervention.

📈 Business Impact

If implemented in a real business setting, this pipeline would help:

Cut unnecessary discount losses by ~10–15%

Improve customer lifetime value (CLV) tracking

Enable data-driven decisions instead of gut-feel pricing
