Got it. Since your repo is aimed at **entry-level DA projects**, the README needs to scream **clarity + professionalism + storytelling**. It should make a recruiter, hiring manager, or client immediately get: *what problem you solved, how you solved it, and what tools you used.*

Here’s a polished draft you can drop in (tweak details if needed):

# Profit Leakage Dashboard

🚀 **Demo Data Analytics Project | SQL • Python • Power BI**

This project demonstrates how **data analytics and visualization** can uncover hidden revenue leakages in online retail sales. It combines **SQL (data modeling), Python (analysis + machine learning), and Power BI (interactive dashboards)** to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Businesses often face **profit leakages** due to:

* Excessive discounts
* High product return rates
* Poorly priced or low-margin products
* Inefficient customer targeting

The goal of this project is to **identify revenue leakage points** and provide **data-driven recommendations** to optimize profitability.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* Source: [Online Retail Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* Records: \~500,000 transactions
* Period: Dec 2010 – Dec 2011
* Key columns: `InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country`

### Transformed into 5 relational tables:

1. **Sales** – Transactions & invoice details
2. **Products** – SKU information & categories
3. **Customers** – Customer segments & countries
4. **Discounts** – Applied discounts & thresholds
5. **Returns** – Returned invoices & quantities

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation (PostgreSQL)**

   * Designed relational schema (5 tables)
   * Cleaned missing values, duplicates, and invalid entries
   * Created indexes & joins for efficient querying

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**

   * Feature engineering: discount %, return frequency, profit margins
   * Cohort analysis for customer behavior
   * SKU-level profitability breakdown

3. **Predictive Analytics (Python, scikit-learn)**

   * Built a classification model to predict **high return-risk SKUs**
   * Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**

   * Interactive dashboard with slicers for:

     * Discounts vs Profitability
     * High-risk SKUs & categories
     * Customer segments & returns trend

5. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Flagged SKUs driving **70% of profit loss**
   * Found discounts >15% **erode margins significantly**
   * Identified **repeat returners** among customers
   * Suggested **price optimization** & stricter return policies

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

*(Insert screenshot of your Power BI dashboard here)*

Key features:

* Dynamic filters (time, region, SKU)
* Drilldowns on discounts, returns, and revenue
* Clear KPIs: Net Revenue, Lost Profit, High-Risk SKUs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Visualization**: Power BI
* **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jk-mn/ProfitLeakageDashboard.git
   cd ProfitLeakageDashboard
   ```

2. Import SQL schema into PostgreSQL (`SQL/schema.sql`).

3. Run Python scripts for data preprocessing & model training (`Python/`).

4. Open `ProfitLeakage.pbix` in Power BI to explore the dashboard.
